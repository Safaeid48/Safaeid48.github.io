Hello! 

I am currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Ontik Technology](https://therapbd.com/), where I lead the machine learning team. My research interests are at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**, with a particular focus on **multimodal learning** and **low-resourced domains**.

Before joining here at Ontik Technology,

- I worked under [Dr. Sejuti Rahman](https://www.du.ac.bd/index.php/faculty/faculty_details/RME/2150) as a **Undergraduate Research Assistant** to design and implement a novel architecture for Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) translation, setting the first benchmark in this field.

Feel free to drop me an email if you'd like to connect!
